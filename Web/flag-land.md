It seems like a translation service from Hello world in English

If we scroll through all the country options, we notice ```Flagistan``` at the very top!

If we click on this and see the translate we will be given the flag

Or do we, this was very suprising to see since I didn't encouter this issue during the challenge but all you have to do is reset cookies and be in the United States.
